// We can use the Trouble plugin to list out warnings and errors in a separate
// window. Open Trouble with `<SPACE>xx`, then jump to the Trouble window with
// `CTRL-J` (or Leap with `gs`). Next, position your cursor over one of the
// errors or warnings and press enter to jump to it.
//
// You can use `]d` to jump to the next diagnostic relative to your cursor
// position, and you can use `[d` to jump backwards. If you want to jump only
// to errors, use `]e` or `[e`. (Diagnostics includes lints and warnings).
