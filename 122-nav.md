## Buffers

Buffers are files that have been loaded into memory. They are called "buffer"
instead of "files" because we can display more than just files in the editor.

Buffers can be switched using `<SHIFT-H>` and `<SHIFT-L>`. The "tabs" at the
top of the IDE are actually the available buffers to cycle through. We will
cover faster buffer switching in a later video.

## Windows / Splits

Windows are like tabs in a traditional IDE. They can be open, closed, and
resized. Unlike traditional tabs, the content of windows can be changed
at-will. You are currently viewing this file in a window.

"Splits" create new windows where buffers can be displayed.

1. Create a new horizontal split with `<SPACE>-`.

2. Create a new vertical split with `<SPACE>|`

3. Jump to different windows by holding `<CTRL>` and pressing `h`, `j`, `k`, or `l`. 

4. Resize a window vertically with `<CTRL-W>{count}+` or `<CTRL-W>{count}-`.

5. Resize a window horizontally with `<CTRL-W>{count}>` or `<CTRL-W>{count}<`.

6. Equalize the size of windows with `<CTRL-W>=`.

## Tabs

A "tab" in Vim has no relation to traditional IDE tabs. Vim tabs contain a
window layout, along with the buffers loaded within those windows. It's similar
to virtual desktops for operating systems, but with files.

1. Read the entire line below before running the commands:

     Create a new tab with `<SPACE><TAB><TAB>`, and then use `<SPACE><TAB>[` to
     jump back to this tab.

   After creating the tab, you'll notice a `1` and `2` at the top right of the
   IDE. This shows which tab is currently active and how many are open.

2. Open this file (`121-nav.md`) in the other tab by switching to the tab with
   `<SPACE><TAB>]` followed by `<SPACE>e` to open `neo-tree` (explorer). Once
   `neo-tree` is open, you can open the file by moving the cursor over
   `121-nav.md` and pressing `<ENTER>`.

3. Create a few splits using the shortcuts in the `## Window / Splits` section,
   and then switch between tabs to see how the layout changes.

Tabs are useful when working with secondary information or code. For example,
you can have documentation in one tab, and code in your main tab. Or you can
have test code in a second tab and only jump to it when you want to work with
some tests. For information that you want to switch between frequently, using
buffers and windows is more appropriate. Tabs are more for things that don't
need constant/immediate access, but still is convenient to have available.
